staring at a blank page 

honestly theses days we rarely are dealing with a truly blank page. a lot of the times there is some unwritten brief. we don't create out of thin air and we should not. we don't exist in a vaccum and thats that's the same with our thoughts. 

we are made up of previous experiances. 

our products and designs are made of the same matter that circulated earth for eons (long timeeeee) 

circular economy is not a joke, it's not abstraction.
in a long run everything will turn into dust and everything comes from something else. 

but it doesn't mean we shouldn't think about it. 
there is contamination happening when we don't consider where are we coming from and were are we going. 

i would like to know what thoughts are made of but honsestly i'm not sure 

sitting down to write this i didn't know what i have in my head. 
i didn't know how i feel and i still don;t know 
yet thoughts and feelings are flowing outside. 

nothing we do is random. 
it has been proven that humans have hard time producing random patterns. 

when you try to put dots on paper after some time your're starting to do it in some way, patterns emerge. 

we can do pseudo-random

even if we think that what we are doing is random 

(defininition of raandom) 

it is usually not. it's steared by some algrorithm, some thought, some way, principle or sth

there is a motive or value that leads us in this times 

we can call it intuition, moral compass, luck or way 

we can also follow it if we think we are aligned with where we are heading 

don't let us be fooled. 

someone must have programmed the autopilot. 

someone or something designed how materials, products and objects are being used 

someone thought how we should live

someone thought how we should think 

and how we create
