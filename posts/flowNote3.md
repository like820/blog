habits habits habits 
it's a third day of writing in the morning and i already consider not commiting to it.
i woke up without alarm clock, stretched, rolled my back 
and there was nothing going on in my head worthy of writing down
did i already pour it out or do i just have to tap into another source
tap tap tap on the keyboard as i tap my fingers i can feel the tips 
i can feel my body and hasn't waken up properly 
although touch feels quite strong
i touch my blanket and feel it's texture dingling my skin 
i can touch the laptops cold and even enclousure
i can feel my head being empty 
like it was about to fly away 
or is it maybe lack of water 
.
.
.
okay i feel a bit different after this glass of water 

i remember now how i have started my days with a glass of water and salt 

i remember the days which i started reading a book laying in my bad 

i remember those where i had to get up and jump on my bike 

or when the first thing was indulgance

substances 

substances seem to be powerful way to control the habits

they provide me with quite a consistent set of perceptual queues and sometimes even effects 

what do i mean by this

lets take coffee

even making coffee triggers a certain reaction in me 

even writing about coffee makes me feel the smell and makes me want to go and start a day off. with this 

warm, black, bitter and energising substance

if i can program myslef with habits then substances provide quite an easy way to trigger something. 

for me coffee means break? 

for some poeple it means work and maybe it does a bit for me 

but moret than that it makes me wake up 

makes me woke 

being present and watching your life unfold is a skill that i'd like to maseter 

moving with intention and using tools i have at hand to achive that 

hmmm i lost focus and started rambling some lines ago 

there is a lawn mower outside

could write a bit about distractions as well
.
but i got distracted. maybe next time
